# Python Number Guessing Game

This repository contains a simple number guessing game implemented in Python.

## How the Game Works
- The program generates a random number between 1 and 50
- The user gets 10 attempts to guess the number
- After each incorrect guess, the program gives a hint
- The game ends when the number is guessed or all attempts are used

## Concepts Used
- while loop
- Conditional statements
- random module
- User input handling

## Purpose
To improve logical thinking and practice loops, conditionals, and random number generation in Python.
